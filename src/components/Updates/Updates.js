								It is not quite as catchy a song when you sing it like that...
								Last week I decided to start a C++ course. I did a little coding
								in C++ when I was super young, and it actually feels a little
								nostalgic! I thought broadening my language base would be good
								and C++ is a great one to have in the tool belt.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								C++ is a high-level programming language used to develop
								software for a variety of applications. It is an object-oriented
								language that was designed to be a faster and more efficient
								alternative to the original C programming language. It is widely
								used in developing operating systems (Windows), web browsers
								(Chrome and Safari for example), and video games.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								One of the key features of C++ is its ability to work with
								memory directly, which allows programmers to write code that is
								highly optimized for performance. It also has a large standard
								library of pre-written code that can be used to perform common
								tasks, such as input/output operations, string manipulation, and
								math functions. C++ is a versatile language that can be used for
								a wide range of programming tasks, from small scripts to
								large-scale software development projects.

								Bootcamp Technical Interviews Done!
							</p>
							<br />
							<img
								src='./images/updateImages/04-24/exam.jpg'
								alt='elephant'
								className='left'
							/>

							<p>
								My first technical interviews are done. The amount of anxiety I
								felt leading up to the last one was almost debilitating. I think
								it was because it was my first choice in bootcamps, I knew the
								content would be challenging and I also know that it has a high
								failure rate on first attempts.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I am not sure I would even describe one of them as a technical
								interview. It was more of a basic test of logical thinking and
								problem-solving skills. There was no actual coding involved. I
								am positive I have passed that one and will be offered a spot in
								the bootcamp.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The next one I did was a different animal. It was probably a
								little more representative of what a technical interview with a
								potential employer would look and feel like. For the first ten
								or fifteen minutes I was having trouble remembering basic syntax
								and built in functions. Once I completed a few of the problems
								and got the nerves settled it was getting better.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The bootcamp I am leaning towards places a high value on their
								candidates being able to communicate effectively while they
								code. Going in I knew this would probably be my weak spot as I
								have never done it. All my coding conversations have always been
								in my head and silent! While I completed all the actual problems
								without help or direction, I know that my communication could
								probably have been better. I think I will probably be asked to
								do a second round technical interview so in the meantime I will
								focus hard on getting some pari programming in and really work
								on my communication skills.

							<br />
							<img

							<p>
								While I was updating the books section this week it occurred to
								me that I have never given a bad review on a book I have posted.
								It may seem to anyone looking at this that I am either WAY too
								soft a critic or really lucky when picking books.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I have definitely read books in the past that I disliked or even
								in rare cases did not finish (unfinished books have mostly been
								works of fiction) but when I started this whole experiment, I
								made a curated list of books to draw from that were all highly
								recommended on "best of" lists or by people I find interesting
								or admire. I add to the list as I come across mentions of books
								that I think would be interesting. When I am ready for a new
								book, I pick one that I think suits my current mood.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It is also worth mentioning that I usually have three or four on
								the go at once and kind of rotate through them depending on my
								mood that day as well. Another reason for this is that sometimes
								I just need a break from a particularly difficult read to abosrb
								the material for a bit. When I add a book to the Books section,
								sometimes it is a book I have literally been ready for months.

							<p className='t-medium bold center'>I Am Exposing Myself!</p>
							<br />

							<p>
								I have never thought of myself as a shy person or lacking any
								kind of social confidence. As it turns out I am capable of
								feeling some pretty extreme social anxiety. While researching
								bootcamps and mock interviews to get ready for my eventual
								serious job search it became apparent that a skillset I was not
								working on was coding with or in front of other people.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								To start working on this I have started getting on video chats
								with other coders going through the same process with one of the
								bootcamps I applied to. I also started attending live workshops
								with other coders. I was painfully anxious before the first
								workshop I attended. Imposter syndrome was in FULL effect!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Thankfully, even after only a few experiences, it has started
								getting easier. The nerves only start to creep up a few minutes
								before events as opposed to hours of stress leading up to it. As
								with many things, it seems the more I do it the less it will
								affect me. Growth really does come from getting out of the
								comfort zones.

							<br />
							<p>
								I did meet and greets with two bootcamps this past week. Both
								were fairly casual and basically a "get to know me" session. One
								of them was a little more interested in what types of support
								mechanisms I had to help cope with the inevitable stresses and
								frustrations that will come with the rigorous learning tempo. I
								liked that they asked about that. It made me feel that they
								cared about the mental health of their students and that their
								curriculum is sufficiently difficult to prepare me well. Both
								bootcamps invited me to the next stage of the admissions
								process.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								While I do not think many are turned away at this stage it was
								still somewhat gratifying and felt like I started down the path.
								There are still technical interviews to pass to ensure I am
								capable of handling their program. Both programs are meant to
								prepare for mid to senior levels positions so a certain amount
								of knowledge is expected going in. One of them said upfront that
								I will likely fail my first attempt at the technical interview.
								They allow up to three tries. I have scheduled technical
								interviews for both.

							<br />
							<img

							<p>
								I have decided it is time to add a more focused routine to my
								resistance training. I'll post up a detailed outline in the next
								couple weeks. I will be training differently than I ever did
								when I was younger. Which, I hate to admit, makes sense at my
								age. My concerns are becoming more about longevity rather than
								size and one rep maxes.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Time under tension is just a fancy way of saying how long your
								muscle was flexed during any given repetition of an exercise.
								So, slowing the movement down increases the time under tension.
								While there are plenty of studies that indicate this can be an
								effective way to build muscle mass, I will be using moderate to
								light weights to hopefully increase endurance while encouraging
								long and lean muscle growth.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Pushing that big weight is addicting and a rush when you hit
								those new highs though, so we will see how long I stick to this
								routine!

							<br />

							<p>
								While technically true, somewhat misleading. While looking
								through online learning resources and websites, I came across a
								recommendation to check out some of the free courses being
								offered online from Harvard and a number of other Ivy League
								schools in the US. There are actually a ton of them available
								with the choice to audit completely for free or, for reasonable
								fees, you can obtain certificates at the end once the course is
								complete.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I landed on an Introduction to Computer Science Course (CS50) at
								Harvard. It is extremely high quality, and the professor is very
								engaging. There are automated unit tests and projects to
								complete every week. I have already learned some things in week
								one that I may never actually apply in a professional
								environment but I think gaining a better understanding of all
								the things that were built and re-built to get us to where we
								are today will be helpful.

							<br />
							<img

							<p>
								So how bad is it? Am I back to the size of an elephant? Can I
								jog more than a minute at a time? Can I code "Hello world!"
								quality programs? Well, it is not great. I definitely took a hit
								on a lot of my performance metrics. My weight got back up to 243
								pounds. A weight I had not seen since December. Body fat did not
								seem to suffer quite as bad a hit, so some of that weight is
								just water and hopefully I can shed some of it pretty quick.
								Cardio took a real hit as well. I had been injured for a couple
								weeks before I stopped everything, so it was nearly a month and
								a half not being on the treadmill. As for coding my brain was
								definitely a little foggy but even after a week of steady coding
								every day my confidence is returning quickly.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								While the break did not help put me in a position where it will
								be easy to hit some of my already lofty targets I think I will
								be able to recover quickly and put in a good push until the end
								of the year. I am going to be careful about keeping my routines
								manageable and really focus on watching my mental state while I
								ramp back up. I do not think I would come back from another
								burnout like that.

							<p>
								I narrowed my bootcamp options down to just a couple. I sent in
								applications to both to get the process started as one of them
								in particular can be a long admissions process. If I am going to
								do a bootcamp, I need to do it soon as my finances and wife's
								patience will only last so long! Just joking about the patience
								thing. She has been extremely supportive of this move and is
								happy to see me pursuing something I have always talked about. I
								think after 20+ years she would be pretty happy to not hear me
								talk about it anymore! Finance concerns are a real thing though.
								And that also weighs into the selection process. There is quite
								a difference between camps price wise.

							<br />

							<p>
								This past week I spent a lot more time coding. A lot of it was
								going back and reviewing things I had already learned but
								because I did not spend much time reinforcing the concepts I
								felt a step back would be good.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								While really having a look over my code and the things I had
								built one of the things I realized is that while I have built up
								a real string understanding of most of the underlying concepts
								and requirements to build a full stack web application, I am
								pretty "messy". So far, all my learning has come from a variety
								of sources (YouTube, Udemy, Codecademy) and not all what I would
								call up to date. In short, I lack a real grounding in "best
								practices".
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Also, I am getting close to the point where I will want to
								seriously start pursuing employment opportunities. I have known
								from the beginning, this part would be challenging given my lack
								of formal education. It can definitely be done but it is a
								hurdle I will face for sure.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								To help with these things and also to really start building out
								my social circle in the industry I have started looking at
								bootcamp options. There are a ton of them out there and it is
								almost overwhelming when waying the pros and cons and even there
								overall value at all. If I am going to do it, it will be soon.
								Stay tuned!

								One of the things that I dropped completely was my efforts on
								Twitter. It has been a long time since I have had positive
								feelings about social media in general, mostly because of my own
								addictive personality and how much I can get sucked into the
								endless swiping. In fact, it has been almost a year since I have
								had a cell phone. After the initial shock and withdrawal it was
								and is pretty liberating not to constantly find myself
								mindlessly scrolling through algo-generated "soft" content.
								Having said this, they can be very powerful tools when used
								responsibly.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I still believe there is great value in using a platform such as
								Twitter to connect with and build a reputation within the tech
								community that I am trying to break into. During my break my
								follower count actually dropped by 10% - Hopefully just Elon
								continuing to sweep out the bots. I have started to tweet again
								and will try to get a reasonable plan together that does not
								make it feel like so much of a chore and also does not suck me
								in too deeply.

							<p className='t-medium bold center'>Clean Energy</p>
							<br />

							<p>
								Energy drinks are something I have struggled with to varying
								degrees since I started drinking them in my 20's. I have
								mentioned it in other updates but I will say it again, I have a
								very addictive, all in, personality. It applies to everything.
								Sometimes it can be a great benefit, as long as I channel it
								properly. For instance, while learning to code it has been a
								massive contributor to the speed that I have been learning at.
								When it comes to energy drinks it has not been good for me.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								In the spirit of celebrating wins, I am now a little over two
								months without having one! That is probably the longest I have
								ever gone without one since I first started drinking them. I
								will not go into detail about how much I have used them at times
								but suffice it to say it was clearly unhealthy.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I do find that with the type of tempo I am keeping it takes work
								and help to maintain focus and energy levels. This can come
								from a lot of different sources starting with a clean diet,
								exercise, less alcohol and better sleep. Those will be my
								cornerstones but I will, much to my absolute disgust, introduce
								tea into my daily routine. Since I was a child, I just cannot
								stand the sight or the smell of it. Having said that there are
								numerous benefits to including teas into my diet, not the least
								of which is helping to regulate energy levels throughout the
								day. *gag*

								Wow! Just what the doctor ordered! I guess I did not realize how
								badly I was becomming burned out and even somewhat resentful of
								some of the expectations I had put on myself. With the exception
								of a couple of weeks off in November due to a solid hit of Covid
								I had been going pretty hard since September. It was four months
								of 50hrs+ a week of coding on top of everything else.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I would say that my plan has worked. I stripped down my routines
								to the most basic. First I got back on track with journaling and
								meditation habits along with some very light exercise. I reduced
								the coding to a minimum. I would say maybe 5-10 hours a week but
								I stopped monitoring it to take the pressure off completely. It
								took a couple weeks to start to get my diet and drinking habits
								cleaned up but I think I finally have a handle on that again as
								well. I am feeling a solid sense of motivation and positivity
								about the whole process again and I feel I am ready and eager to
								ramp up the efforts again.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I will say this. I have come a LONG way! I am not sure if I hit
								my initial goals but I am psitive I will finish the second half
								of this strong. Although it led to a bit of a crash and maybe
								even close to a complete failure, I have also come out with a

								This week I did not engage in any type of exercise. That habit

								was pretty depressing to not be able to do it. I feel like it is
								a big setback (probably not as bad as it feels). I definitely do
								not want to agrivate the injuries so I will be very careful when
								I start to reintroduce anything back into the routine.

								I started reading the book "Cobalt Red" this week and it is

								when it comes to labor conditions and pay scales but this book
								is really eye opening.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It is centered around the history and present conditions of
								cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The
								author takes great personal risk to get up and close with the
								people involved at all levels.

							<br />
							<p>
								Cobalt is an extremely valuable and useful mineral. Most

								we all take for granted in our day to day lives and our created
								demand for it contributes in a tangible way to the continued
								oppression of an entire country.

								I am pretty surprised it took this long to happen to be honest.
								In the physical state that I started in and how long it had been
								since I maintained any kind of consistent exercise routine, I
								should have probably had some injuries already. Well, this week
								it happened. Two of them just to remind me I am not invincible
								anymore.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								On Tuesday, a few minutes into my treadmill work, I felt a sharp
								pain in my left foot. I continued at a walk for a few more
								minutes, which was probably a mistake, and then had to get off.
								Today I got back on for the first time as I was feeling no pain
								walking around the house but kept it to a slow walk with the
								incline ramped up to try and get my heart rate going.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The second injury came on Thursday while doing push ups.
								Something in my left tricep pulled and I had to stop
								immediately. I stayed off it until today when I did a very slow
								23 before I felt it starting to get irritated.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I will take things very easy this week and give myself room to
								heal instead of pushing things and making recovery worse.
								Hopefully, it feels better next week!

								Everything Is Difficult Until It Is Easy!
							</p>
							<br />

							<p>
								Webpages require styling. This is done with something called
								CSS. Up until a few weeks ago, I had been writing all my styling
								from scratch. Although I knew there were tools and libraries to
								help with this, I wanted to ensure I had a solid understanding
								of the basics first. I have now started learning to use two new
								frameworks. Besides making my life a little easier with my
								projects it is knowledge that a lot of employers would be
								looking for as well.
							</p>
							<br />
							<div className='flex'>
								<div>

										alt='bootstrap'
										className='left'

									<p>
										<span className='bold'>BOOTSTRAP</span>
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										Bootstrap is one of, if not the most popular framework for
										CSS styling. It is component based which means you are
										provided with large premade templates that handle multiple
										lines of CSS code at a time. It definitely makes for very
										fast layout design and removes 99% of the headache
										associated with making sure my site is responsive across
										multiple screen sizes.
									</p>
								</div>

							<br />
							<div className='flex'>

										style={{ backgroundColor: 'white', borderRadius: '15%' }}
									/>
									<p>
										<span className='bold'>TAILWIND</span>
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										Tailwind has been gaining a lot of momentum in the last
										couple years. It works a bit differently than Bootstrap in
										that it does not come with a lot of pre-built components.
										You are still applying CSS rules one at a time but with
										Tailwind, you can apply the rules directly to your HTML. It
										saves a TON of time and still allows for full customization
										of my website.
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>
										I am still learning to use both but so far, I think I prefer
										Tailwind. I can already see how they would both have their
										places depending on what type of app you are building, how
										quickly you need to build it, how complicated the UI design
										is, and other factors. Although I will probably never be a
										front-end design person, I think it will be good for me to
										have experience with both under my belt.

								While I am not quite as riddled with anxiety as the rabbit was

								"weekly" updates on Mondays is sure to have noticed that they
								have not been on time in quite a while. This one for instance is
								being posted about 13 days later than it should have been. My
								data has been collected on time and some ideas for updates set
								but the writing and posting have really fallen behind.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It is not that I have not been setting aside time to do it, it
								is that I have very quickly taken on more than my time can
								accommodate. As I spread myself thin everything is suffering as
								far as timelines and deadlines. I am learning a lot about what I
								can accomplish with my time and an important lesson with regard
								to making promises about what I can deliver. If these things
								were in a professional environment, they would not go over well
								or be allowed to continue for very long.
							</p>

								So, it finally happened. The big diet snap! On Sunday night I
								went completely off the rails and ordered a bunch of takeout

								off the low carb (keto) diet, but right off any kind of diet. I

							<p className='t-medium bold'>I've Got an Attitude Problem.</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This week I re-read one of my favorite motivational books of all

								This guy has led some life... He grew up on hard streets
								immersed in violence and crime which eventually lead to prison.
								He then turns it all around with a major overhaul of how he
								approached life.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The forward of the book opens with, "John Joseph has an attitude
								problem. But John's problem isn't his attitude. It's yours.".
								And when you read the book, you have to eventually accept that
								it is. It takes work to maintain the kind of mindset that he
								does but when you do you can be so much more productive and
								happy.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>This week I gave myself an attitude check!</p>

								With the Keto site almost ready and going through the final

								to fall behind a bit. I always have to try and find that
								balance, but it felt good to really be "in the code" the last
								few weeks.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Once the site goes live, hopefully next week, I will shift some

								95% satisfied with both but will continue to tweak and adjust as
								I get feedback. I now have 3 finsihed projects on the web and it
								feels great!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The exciting thing that happened this week was how much traffic
								they have seen. Over time I expect this site to do fairly well
								and my family social has daily use but I did not expect the
								number of visits I have seen on my portfolio site. It crossed
								250 unique visitors yesterday with almost 400 page views. Not
								huge numbers I am sure but pretty cool for my first steps into
								public!

							<p className='t-medium bold'>Christmas Is Coming...</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This week I saw a slight weight increase. I can attribute it
								almost entirely to my first diet snap. A couple of drinks on
								Friday somehow led to 2 days of eating and drinking WAY too
								much... Pizza, wings, perrogies, oh my! It was more than a
								little disappointing stepping on the scale this afternoon but
								these things are going to happen. It will not be the last slip I
								am sure. I will go in to this week strong and get the gains
								(losses) back in no time!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This was probably a mild dry run for what Christmas will look
								like diet wise. With a full house of family here for 3 days
								there will be no shortage of bad (really good) food and drinks
								going around. I will try to stay super clean up to the 24th and
								I am hoping that when I come out the other side I can manage
								something in the mid 230's. Wish me luck!

							<p className='t-medium bold'>Do Comic Books Count?</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Another of my goals that was ambitious. I am starting to feel
								like 50 books will be a real push. With the amount of coding
								that I want to be doing to move goal forward (started working on
								my next site this week) it only leaves so much time for reading.
								Even if I fall short though, like everything else I am doing, it
								will certainly be an improvement. Pretty soon my audiobooks will
								sound like they are on fast forward.

							<br />
							<p>
								The website is up and now providing public accountability for my
								progress. This journey actually started back in mid September,
								but I did not have the skillset to build the website yet. I have
								kept a journal of all my activities since I decided to do all of
								this and I will slowly but surely backfill the Updates section.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It could probably be a little more polished and have better
								background information, but I was excited to get it up and
								putting my story out there. I will be fine tuning the esthetics
								and adding more content frequently as well as posting these
								weekly updates summarizing my progress.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I have put up some of the tracking charts and data in the Data
								section but will be adding more over the next week. I have 32
								data points that I am tracking and will maybe eventually publish
								them all but for now I just want to make sure I get enough up to
								show my general progress.

							<p className='t-medium bold'>Covid is Behind Me</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I am finally feeling completely normal again. After being bed
								ridden for the first two weeks of November and dealing with some
								significant residual effects the rest of the month I can finally
								say that this week I feel like my old self again. It definitely
								put a dent in my momentum with the experiment but I am back
								working towards my goals with 100% effort and motivation.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Am I Really This Fat!?</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I decided to track my body fat percentage. Well, truthfully, I
								was always planning on tracking it but was not ready to see it
								for myself until I had lost a little bit. My fears were well
								founded. I came in this morning at an easily obese 32.69%. If I
								was to make an educated guess as to what it was in September, I
								would say close to 40%. A VERY unhealthy place to be.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Gut Check!</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								So I am 1/4 of the way there. How am I doing? Although a week
								ago I was feeling depressed about my progress I now realize it
								was just the Covid downtime messing with my brain. I felt
								confident coding this week and it reminded me how far I have
								come with that. Physically I am making great progress as well. I
								am down roughly 20lbs since I started and my cardio and strength
								is building every week. I am slightly behind on my book pace,
								but I will beef up my reading time at night. I am still
								confident I can hit my goals!
