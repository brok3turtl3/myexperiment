      <p className='t-medium bold'>The Site is Live!</p>
      <br />
      <p>The website is up and now providing public accountability for my progress. This journey actually started back in mid September but I did not have the skillset to build the website yet. I have kept a journal of all my activities since I decided to do all of this and I will slowly but surely backfill the Updates section.</p>
      <br />
      <p>It could probably be a little more polished and have better background information but I was excited to get it up and putting my story out there. I will be fine tuning the esthetics and adding more content frequently as well as posting these weekly updates summarizing my progress.</p>

      <p className='t-medium bold'>Covid is Behind Me</p>
      <br />
      <p>I am finally feeling completely normal again. After being be ridden for the first two weeks of November and dealing with some significant residual effects the rest of the month I can finally say that this week I feel like my old self again. It definitely put a dent in my momentum with the experiment but I am back work at my goals with 100% effort and motivation.</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Am I Really This Fat!?</p>
      <br />
      <p>I decided to track my body fat percentage. Well, truthfully, I was always planning on tracking it but was not ready to see it for myself until I had lost a little bit. My fears were well founded. I came in this morning at an easily obese 32.69%. If I was to make an educated guess where I was in September I would say close to 40%. A VERY unhealthy place to be.</p>
