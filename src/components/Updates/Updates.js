      <br />
      <p>The title should be read in your best Maxwell Smart voice. If that reference is a little too "Boomery" here ya go: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=oPwrodxghrw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Maxwell</a>.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I was actually pretty close. I really wanted to dip into the 230's for my weight in this week but fell slightly short. I weighed in at 240.5 lbs. My wife is convinced that the secret to my loss this week was the combination of red wine and a crock pot curried chicken on Sunday.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I will try to be super strict for the beginning of this week to give myself a little padding going into the Christmas debauchery!</p>
<br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Have Your Eyes Ever Twitched?</p>
      <br />
      <p>I picked up the pace this week on the reading. I had meant to increase the amount of audio "reading" I was doing but ended up spending all my time with the real thing.</p> 
      <br />
      <p>I started using some basic speed reading techniques I picked up in a book by Jim Kwik called Limitless. It will take a bit of practice but the techniques dramatocally improve speed while maintaining retention.</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>My Flow Is Real.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I had a fantastic week coding. I pushed multiple updates to my family's social app and learned a ton of new things while figuring out how to make things run better or work at all. Inline image loads for background on pages like these was a win, and "lazy loading"...? Common!</p>
      <br />
      <p>I did not watch any new tutorials or spend much time on bootcamp lessons but never the less it was a great week. Next week I will shift a little effort back to those things. I think that a 30/70 split of my time from learning to building stuff is probably the sweet spot.</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Forest Gump Has Nothing On Me!</p>
      <br />
      <p>Well, I could probably beat young Forest while he is still wearing the leg braces BUT, I have come a long way already in just two weeks.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I added graph data for my progress with the running (pronounced "jogging") this week. Right now on the weekly updates I get on the treadmill for 32 min and see how far I can get. If I can add a little more than 0.1 kms every week to my distance I should get to my goal. This week I jump almost a half a kilometer and felt like I had more room to push.</p>

      <p className='t-medium bold'>They Better Be the Slow Kind!</p>
      <br />
      <p>So this week I started doing some light treadmill cardio. My early observation is that when the zombies come, if they are the fast kind, I am in serious trouble!</p>
      <br />
      <p>One of my goals is that after the 1 year mark I will be able to run 5km in 30min. In my first seesion a week ago I managed a distance of 2.19kms in 32min. I have a LONG way to go!</p>
      <br />
      <p>For the first 3 or 4 weeks I will do 30-45min sessions 3 or 4 times a week. After my body is used to the workouts I will adjust and start pushing towards the goal in earnest.</p>
<br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>If You Code It, They Will Come.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Last week I brought this site and my portfolio page online. I am 95% satisfied with both but will continue to tweak and adjust as I get feedback. I now have 3 finsihed projects on the web and it feels great!</p> 
      <br />
      <p>The exciting thing that happened this week was how much traffic they have seen. Over time I expect this site to do fairly well and my family social has daily use but I did not expect the number of visits I have seen on my portfolio site. It crossed 250 unique visitors yesterday with almost 400 page views. Not huge numbers I am sure but pretty cool for my first steps into public!</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Christmas Is Coming...</p>
      <br />
      <p>This week I saw a slight weight increase. I can attribute it almost entirely to my first diet snap. A couple of drinks on Friday somehow led to 2 days of eating and drinking WAY too much... Pizza, wings, perrogies, oh my! It was more than a little disappointing stepping on the scale this afternoon but these things are going to happen. It will not be the last slip I am sure. I will go in to this week strong and get the gains (losses) back in no time!</p>
      <br />
      <p>This was probably a mild dry run for what Christmas will look like diet wise. With a full house of family here for 3 days there will be no shortage of bad (really good) food and drinks going around. I will try to stay super clean up to the 24th and I am hoping that when I come out the other side I can manage something in the mid 230's. Wish me luck!</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Do Comic Books Count?</p>
      <br />
      <p>Another of my goals that was ambitious. I am starting to feel like 50 books will be a real push. With the amount of coding that I want to be doing to move goal forward (started working on my next site this week) it only leaves so much time for reading. Even if I fall short though, like everything else I am doing, it will certainly be an improvement. Pretty soon my audiobooks will sound like they are on fast forward.</p>

      <p className='t-medium bold'>The Site is Live!</p>
      <br />
      <p>The website is up and now providing public accountability for my progress. This journey actually started back in mid September, but I did not have the skillset to build the website yet. I have kept a journal of all my activities since I decided to do all of this and I will slowly but surely backfill the Updates section.</p>
      <br />
      <p>It could probably be a little more polished and have better background information, but I was excited to get it up and putting my story out there. I will be fine tuning the esthetics and adding more content frequently as well as posting these weekly updates summarizing my progress.</p>
      <br />
      <p>I have put up some of the tracking charts and data in the Data section but will be adding more over the next week. I have 32 data points that I am tracking and will maybe eventually publish them all but for now I just want to make sure I get enough up to show my general progress.</p>
<br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Covid is Behind Me</p>
      <br />
      <p>I am finally feeling completely normal again. After being bed ridden for the first two weeks of November and dealing with some significant residual effects the rest of the month I can finally say that this week I feel like my old self again. It definitely put a dent in my momentum with the experiment but I am back working towards my goals with 100% effort and motivation.</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Am I Really This Fat!?</p>
      <br />
      <p>I decided to track my body fat percentage. Well, truthfully, I was always planning on tracking it but was not ready to see it for myself until I had lost a little bit. My fears were well founded. I came in this morning at an easily obese 32.69%. If I was to make an educated guess as to what it was in September, I would say close to 40%. A VERY unhealthy place to be.</p>
      <br />
      <p className='t-medium bold'>Gut Check!</p>
      <br />
      <p>So I am 1/4 of the way there. How am I doing? Although a week ago I was feeling depressed about my progress I now realize it was just the Covid downtime messing with my brain. I felt confident coding this week and it reminded me how far I have come with that. Physically I am making great progress as well. I am down roughly 20lbs since I started and my cardio and strength is building every week. I am slightly behind on my book pace, but I will beef up my reading time at night. I am still confident I can hit my goals!</p>
