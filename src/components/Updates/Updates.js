								So, it finally happened. The big diet snap! On Sunday night I went completely off the rails and ordered a bunch of takeout food and had a fair amount of red wine to wash it down. Not only off the low carb (keto) diet, but right off any kind of diet. I won't go into details but it was roughly 3 days worth of the calories I have been getting lately.</p>
<br />
								<p>
								Needless to say, I am feeling a little sluggish today and the aftereffects are definitely reflected in the weekly weigh in. I am not going to beat myself up about it - I deserved it!

							<br />
							
							<p className='t-medium bold'>
								I've Got an Attitude Problem.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This week I re-read one of my favorite motivational books of all time - The PMA Effect. It was written by John Joseph McGowan. This guy has led some life... He grew up on hard streets immersed in violence and crime which eventually lead to prison. He then turns it all around with a major overhaul of how he approached life. 
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>The forward of the book opens with, "John Joseph has an attitude problem. But John's problem isn't his attitude. It's yours.". And when you read the book, you have to eventually accept that it is. It takes work to maintain the kind of mindset that he does but when you do you can be so much more productive and happy.</p>
							<br />
							<p>This week I gave myself an attitude check!</p>
							
							
							
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>My Hands Are Filthy!</p>

							<p>
								With the Keto site almost ready and going through the final tweaks and tests I spent a ton of my time this week at the keyboard coding again. So much so that everything else started to fall behind a bit. I always have to try and find that balance, but it felt good to really be "in the code" the last few weeks.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>Once the site goes live, hopefully next week, I will shift some of my energy back to the mental health side of things. Reading, meditation, Yoga etc... It's time to unwind and rest my mind a little bit.</p>

							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Even the Greats Get Writer's Block!</p>
							<br />
							<p>So I was asked to write a technical article and I have a ton of ideas and things I know I want to say, but I have not written one line. I wrote some code that I plan to use as examples and snippets but not one line of the article itself. I really thought going in that this would be super easy and fast but I find I second guess everything that I try to say.</p>
							<br />
							<p>It is a great opportunity for me to build some tech credentials and obviously a great learning experience. I never thought it would be this tough! I am trying not to be too hard on myself as I know even accomplished authors and writers can run into this. I think next week I will just start spilling my brains out onto paper (keyboard) and then clean it up after.</p>

								This week I started to struggle again with checking off all my

								much to one task. Lately that has been the Keto site. I can also

							<p>
								The storefront which is now complete was MUCH easier than I had

							<p>
								I had an amazing holiday season with my family. It was the first
								one in a couple of years where we could get everyone together at
								our home for Christmas Day. While I would not trade this for the
								world it does lead to some poor diet behavior. As well, I pretty
								much ignored most of my daily routines for the week. Even in
								that short, time I feel the loss of motivation to get through my

							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This week will be all about pushing through the wall of lethargy

								habits.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Construction Has Begun.</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								While it was not a stellar week for my overall progress I did

								next portfolio site - KetoCorner.ca. The site will be a
								ketogenic lifestyle site with a recipe database, blog, and
								article section as well as a fully functional storefront. Not
								sure exactly what will be sold there yet but I am going to build
								it!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This will be another fairly large project, but I am hoping to

								I picked up the pace this week on the reading. I had meant to
								increase the amount of audio "reading" I was doing but ended up
								spending all my time with the real thing.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I started using some basic speed-reading techniques I picked up
								in a book by Jim Kwik called Limitless. It will take a bit of
								practice, but the techniques dramatically improve speed while
								maintaining retention.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>My Flow Is Real.</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I had a fantastic week coding. I pushed multiple updates to my
								family's social app and learned a ton of new things while
								figuring out how to make things run better or work at all.
								Preload and inline image loads for background on pages like
								these was a win, and "lazy loading" for my social site...?
								Common!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I did not watch any new tutorials or spend much time on Bootcamp
								lessons but nevertheless it was a great week. Next week I will
								shift a little effort back to those things. I think that a 30/70
								split of my time from learning to building stuff is probably the
								sweet spot.

							<p className='t-medium bold'>Forest Gump Has Nothing On Me!</p>

								Well, I could probably beat young Forest while he is still

							<br />
							<p>
								I added graph data for my progress with running (pronounced
								"jogging") this week. Right now, on the weekly updates I get on
								the treadmill for 32 min and see how far I can get. If I can add
								a little more than 0.1 kms every week to my distance, I should
								get to my goal. In two weeks I jumped almost half a kilometer

							<p className='t-medium bold'>They Better Be the Slow Kind!</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								So this week I started doing some light treadmill cardio. My
								early observation is that when the zombies come, if they are the
								fast kind, I am in serious trouble!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								One of my goals is that after the 1 year mark I will be able to
								run 5km in 30min. In my first seesion a week ago I managed a
								distance of 2.19kms in 32min. I have a LONG way to go!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								For the first 3 or 4 weeks I will do 30-45min sessions 3 or 4
								times a week. After my body is used to the workouts I will
								adjust and start pushing towards the goal in earnest.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>If You Code It, They Will Come.</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Last week I brought this site and my portfolio page online. I am
								95% satisfied with both but will continue to tweak and adjust as
								I get feedback. I now have 3 finsihed projects on the web and it
								feels great!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								The exciting thing that happened this week was how much traffic
								they have seen. Over time I expect this site to do fairly well
								and my family social has daily use but I did not expect the
								number of visits I have seen on my portfolio site. It crossed
								250 unique visitors yesterday with almost 400 page views. Not
								huge numbers I am sure but pretty cool for my first steps into
								public!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Christmas Is Coming...</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This week I saw a slight weight increase. I can attribute it
								almost entirely to my first diet snap. A couple of drinks on
								Friday somehow led to 2 days of eating and drinking WAY too
								much... Pizza, wings, perrogies, oh my! It was more than a
								little disappointing stepping on the scale this afternoon but
								these things are going to happen. It will not be the last slip I
								am sure. I will go in to this week strong and get the gains
								(losses) back in no time!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								This was probably a mild dry run for what Christmas will look
								like diet wise. With a full house of family here for 3 days
								there will be no shortage of bad (really good) food and drinks
								going around. I will try to stay super clean up to the 24th and
								I am hoping that when I come out the other side I can manage
								something in the mid 230's. Wish me luck!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Do Comic Books Count?</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Another of my goals that was ambitious. I am starting to feel
								like 50 books will be a real push. With the amount of coding
								that I want to be doing to move goal forward (started working on
								my next site this week) it only leaves so much time for reading.
								Even if I fall short though, like everything else I am doing, it
								will certainly be an improvement. Pretty soon my audiobooks will
								sound like they are on fast forward.

								kept a journal of all my activities since I decided to do all of

							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								It could probably be a little more polished and have better

								and adding more content frequently as well as posting these
								weekly updates summarizing my progress.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I have put up some of the tracking charts and data in the Data

							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Covid is Behind Me</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I am finally feeling completely normal again. After being bed
								ridden for the first two weeks of November and dealing with some
								significant residual effects the rest of the month I can finally
								say that this week I feel like my old self again. It definitely
								put a dent in my momentum with the experiment but I am back

							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Am I Really This Fat!?</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								I decided to track my body fat percentage. Well, truthfully, I
								was always planning on tracking it but was not ready to see it
								for myself until I had lost a little bit. My fears were well
								founded. I came in this morning at an easily obese 32.69%. If I
								was to make an educated guess as to what it was in September, I
								would say close to 40%. A VERY unhealthy place to be.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p className='t-medium bold'>Gut Check!</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								So I am 1/4 of the way there. How am I doing? Although a week
								ago I was feeling depressed about my progress I now realize it
								was just the Covid downtime messing with my brain. I felt
								confident coding this week and it reminded me how far I have
								come with that. Physically I am making great progress as well. I
								am down roughly 20lbs since I started and my cardio and strength
								is building every week. I am slightly behind on my book pace,
								but I will beef up my reading time at night. I am still
								confident I can hit my goals!
